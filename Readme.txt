OVERVIEW
--------
This game was written within a 72-hour period as a part of the Toronto Game Jam (tojam.ca). The theme was "the world is NOT ending", so I decided to build off of the original multi-level concept from Cutscene Platformer 1. The objective is to find a key to unlock the door. A large improvement over Cutscene Platformer 1 is the ability for the player to travel anywhere they want. There are approximately 40 different screens available for the player to navigate.
